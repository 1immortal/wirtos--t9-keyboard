# stratos-t9-keyboard
Simple keyboard app for Amazfit Stratos. Originally for private usage only.
No autocomplete, only English and Russian languages, all dimensions are hardcoded, no way to set as default keyboard (works only with [AmazMod](https://github.com/AmazMod/AmazMod)).

### How it looks like:

Russian             |  English
